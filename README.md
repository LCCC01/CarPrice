# CarPrice
Application that calculates the mean price for new cars. Data is fetched from an API that Skatteverket has. 

There is two ways to get the mean price information for a fueltype.

If you just want to JSON-data, you can go to:

http://localhost:8080/car/get-mean/{fueltype}

If you want to view the mean prices visually in a line chart, you can go to:

http://localhost:8080/car/view/{fueltype}
